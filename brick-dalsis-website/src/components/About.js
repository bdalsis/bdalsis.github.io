      <h1>Hi, I'm Brick Dalsis</h1>
      <p>
      I just graduated from the Colorado School of Mines in May of 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I love video games, the outdoors (specifically playing disc golf and snowboarding), and programming. My goal right now is to get an entry-level job somewhere in the industry, while also continuing to bolster my portfolio with personal projects. If possible, I would love to get a job in the video game industry or in the cryptography sphere, but I enjoy all aspects of computer science and would love an opportunity in any sector of the computer science industry.
