          <p>
            I'm a recent graduate from the Colorado School of Mines (May 2024) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm passionate about coding and am currently looking for a role in the computer science industry.

            In my free, I enjoy disc golf, snowboarding, hiking, and playing video games. I also love to travel â€” I spent five months studying abroad in Norway starting in August 2023, which was an incredible experience.
